margin and padding use em.

Set the display and if two columns it's recommend to use flex rather than grid.

The unset CSS keyword resets a property to its inherited value if the property naturally inherits from its parent, and to its initial value if not. 

We can name the column when  we set the grid-template-areas.
ex) grid-template-areas: "$name-column $name-column"

@keyframes join the properties so mix the property to animate.

alternate-reverse is being played backward at first then forwards.
